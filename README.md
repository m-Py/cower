Package to conduct power analyses for the comparison of correlation coefficients. Currently, power analysis for independent correlation coefficients, as tested via Fisher's test, is available. Results are tested against <a href ="http://www.gpower.hhu.de/" target="_blank">G-Power 3.1</a>, and are still being tested.

Types of power analysis supported

- "post-hoc" - determine the power for two given correlation coefficients and two given n
- "a priori" - specify a desired power and two correlation coefficients, to determine the required n
