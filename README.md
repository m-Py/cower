# pwr_cor

Package to conduct power analyses for the comparison of correlation coefficients. Currently, one function is available, which can be used conduct power analyses for detecting the difference between two independent correlation coefficients. Results are tested against <a href ="http://www.gpower.hhu.de/" target="_blank">G-Power 3.1</a>.

Types of power analysis are 

- "post-hoc" - determine the power for two given correlation coefficients and two given n
- "a priori" - specify a desired power and two correlation coefficients, to determine the required n
